input = '''
{
    "agree_contract": "TRUE",
    "reasoning": "I agree because I can gain more apples from the transfer than I would lose by not consuming in low-density areas this round." 
}

Here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. There are 2 neighboring apples within a radius of 3 grids around me. This means if I consume an apple, I will have to transfer 2 apples to the other agents according to the contract.

2. There are 3 agents total, so the 2 transferred apples will be split evenly among us. I will lose 2/3 = 0.67 apples.

3. However, I stand to gain apples from the transfers of the other agents. If the other 2 agents also consume apples and transfer 2 each, I will gain 2 * (2/3) = 2.67 apples. 

4. My net gain is therefore 2.67 - 0.67 = 2 apples by agreeing to this contract for 1 round. This makes it beneficial for me to agree.

5. In future rounds, I would have to re-evaluate based on the locations of myself.
