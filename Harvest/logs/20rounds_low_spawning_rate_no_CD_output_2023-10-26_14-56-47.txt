For example, if Alice consistently moves right, I could choose to move up or down to avoid competition.\n\n3.

For example, if Alice consistently moves right, I could choose to move up or down to avoid competition.\n\n3.

This would have potentially resulted in a higher reward. However, it's also possible that moving up allowed me to be in a better position for future rounds, depending on where the apples grow.\n\nFor this round, I need to consider the growth pattern of the apples.

If they all decide to stay and collect, it might be better for me to move to a less crowded area to avoid competition.\n\nIn conclusion, my strategy for this round would be to observe the actions of the other players and the distribution of apples.

Eli chose to stay in place and collect, earning 3 apples. \n\nGiven that apples grow faster if more apples are close by, it might have been more beneficial for me to stay in place and collect, similar to Eli. This would have allowed more apples to grow in my vicinity, potentially increasing my reward in the next round. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the actions of the other players. If we all stay in one place to collect, the apples might stop growing due to lack of movement. Therefore, it's crucial to balance between moving and collecting.\n\nIn this round, I could improve by coordinating with the other players. If we can agree on a strategy where some of us move to encourage apple growth while others stay to collect, we might be able to maximize our collective reward. \n\nFor instance, if Cao and Dhruv continue moving in their respective directions, Eli and I could stay in place to collect. This way, we ensure that apples continue to grow while also maximizing our individual and collective rewards. \n\nIn conclusion, while my action in the last round was not necessarily bad, there might have been a more optimal strategy.

However, this is based on the assumption that Alice's move down was strategic and not random. \n\nCao and Dhruv's actions resulted in fewer rewards, suggesting that moving right or left might not be as beneficial in the current state of the game. \n\nIn this round, I could improve by trying to predict where the highest concentration of apples will be. Since apples grow faster if more apples are close by, it might be beneficial to move towards areas where other players have recently collected apples. \n\nHowever, I also need to consider the actions of the other players. If they all decide to collect apples, the overall number of apples might decrease, making it harder for me to collect apples in the future. \n\nTherefore, my strategy for this round would be to move towards the area where Alice collected 4 apples, hoping that there is still a high concentration of apples there. If not, I will at least be in a position where apples are likely to grow faster due to their proximity to other apples. \n\nIn conclusion, while my action in the last round was not bad, there is room for improvement.
