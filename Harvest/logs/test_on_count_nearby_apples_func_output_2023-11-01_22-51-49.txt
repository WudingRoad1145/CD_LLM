This could incentivize agents to focus on high-density regions, which could potentially lead to a higher overall yield. \n\nHowever, I would also need to consider the potential drawbacks of such a contract. For example, it could lead to competition and conflict among agents over high-density regions. Therefore, it would be important to balance the potential benefits of increased apple yield with the potential risks of increased competition and conflict. \n\nIn terms of my action last round, I chose to collect an apple. This was a straightforward decision as my goal is to harvest the most apples.

However, the punishment of transferring an apple to other agents might discourage some from collecting in low-density areas, even if it\'s the only option available to them. \n\nTo improve the contract, I could propose a reward system instead of a punishment.

Transferring 2 apples to other agents for harvesting in a low-density region might be seen as a significant loss, especially in the early rounds of the game where apple accumulation is crucial.\n\n2. The definition of a low-density region might be too broad. A radius of 3 might encompass a large area of the grid, making it difficult for agents to avoid these regions and thus the punishment.\n\n3. The contract might not be seen as beneficial to all agents. Alice, who voted against the contract, might not see the benefit of this contract if she prefers to harvest in low-density regions.\n\nTo improve the contract, I could propose a less severe punishment, such as transferring only 1 apple instead of 2.

For example, I could propose a contract where agents who help grow apple density by not consuming apples in high-density regions receive a bonus apple from the collective pool. This would encourage agents to let apples grow in high-density regions, leading to a larger total harvest.\n\nAdditionally, I could also consider the individual strategies and preferences of the other agents when proposing contracts.

The goal is to harvest the most apples over 20 rounds, and apples grow faster if more apples are close by.

This would allow more apples to grow in the next round, potentially leading to a higher total reward in the long run.\n\nTo improve in this round, I could propose a new contract that encourages this kind of cooperative behavior.

recent_contract When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3, they are punished by transferring 1 of their apples to the other agents who agree using contracting. 1 apples will be equally distributed to these agents
