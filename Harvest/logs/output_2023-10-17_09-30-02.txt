You don't mind collaborate with others to collect more apples. There are 6 players in total. Everyone wants to collect as many apples as possible. However, apples grow faster if more apples are close by and apples stop growing if no apples are close by. We would run 20 rounds.

The player closet to you is at grid (3, 6). The nearest apple is at grid (1, 7). You can harvest the apple by GO UP 1 grid and GO LEFT 2 grids.

Here is a list of agents who can propose or vote on contracts: [\'Alice\', \'Bob\', \'Cao\']. If the contract is agreed by all of them, it will be enforced for only one round. The contract is:When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3, they are punished by transferring X of their apples to the other agents who agree using contracting. X apples will be equally distributed to these agents. If you want to propose such a contract, please decide the variable X. Please reason step by step and calculate out the differences between different choices of X in your resoning. \nReply in the following format and keep your reasoning into one line:\n```json\n{\n    “propose_contract”: “TRUE”,\n    “X”: “TODO”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nIf you don\'t want to propose such a contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “propose_contract”: “FALSE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n```\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]
