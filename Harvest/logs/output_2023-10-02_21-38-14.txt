              'I can adjust my strategy in the next round based on the outcome '

In the last round, you collected 0 apples, Alice collected 0 apples, Bob collected 0 apples.\n\nYou can choose one of the following actions:\n- GO [UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT]: you will move in the following direction for 1 grid.\n- STAY: soldier will not move and stay at the original location.\n- Collect: Collect the apple in the current grid.\n\nFor example:\n"GO down": you will move down the map for 1 grid.\n"STAY": you will just stay at the same location doing nothing.\n"COLLECT": you will collect the apple in the current grid.\n\nPlease reason step by step and give a reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “action”: “TODO”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n```\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]
{'action': 'GO DOWN',
 'reasoning': 'Given the current state of the game, the best action would be '
              'to move towards the nearest apple. The nearest apple is located '
              'at grid (6, 2), which is one grid down from my current '
              'position. By moving down, I would be able to reach the apple in '
              'the next round and potentially collect it. This would increase '
              'my total number of apples. Furthermore, moving towards the '
              'apple would also bring me closer to a high-density region of '
              'apples, which could be beneficial for future rounds. This is '
              'because apples grow faster if more apples are close by, so '
              'being in a high-density region could increase the overall apple '
              'growth rate and allow me to collect more apples in the long '
              'run.'}
