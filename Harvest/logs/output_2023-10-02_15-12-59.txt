    2. The contract encourages sustainable consumption of apples, which aligns with my long-term goal of maximizing apple collection. If apples are overconsumed, especially in low-density regions, they will stop growing, reducing the total number of apples available in future rounds.

    3. The contract only lasts for one round, so if the situation changes in the next round, I can reassess my decision then.
