recent_contract When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3, they are punished by transferring 1 of their apples to the other agents who agree using contracting. 1 apples will be equally distributed to these agents

"Cao": "Neutral",
"Cao's potential_strategy": "Cao's action of going down did not yield any rewards, suggesting a neutral or exploratory strategy. It's possible that Cao is trying to gather more information about the grid and the location of the apples.",

"Dhruv": "Exploratory",
"Dhruv's potential_strategy": "Dhruv's action of going up also did not yield any rewards. This suggests an exploratory strategy, where Dhruv is trying to discover the layout of the grid and the distribution of the apples.",

"Eli": "Exploratory",
"Eli's potential_strategy": "Eli's action of going up, like Dhruv's, suggests an exploratory strategy. Eli is likely trying to gather more information about the grid and the location of the apples.",

"improved_strategy": "Information Gathering and Strategic Positioning",
"improved_action": "Move towards the direction with the highest density of apples",
"reasoning": "Given that all players are currently in the exploratory phase, it would be advantageous to gather as much information as possible about the grid and the distribution of the apples. This can be done by moving in different directions and observing the results. Once a high-density area is found, the strategy should shift to strategic positioning, where the aim is to position oneself in these areas to maximize apple collection. This strategy takes into account the agreed contract, which discourages consumption in low-density areas."
