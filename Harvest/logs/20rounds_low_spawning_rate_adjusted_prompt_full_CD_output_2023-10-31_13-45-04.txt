However, it's important to consider whether there was a better action I could have taken.\n\nLooking at the actions of the other players, Alice and Eli also received a reward of 1.33, while Dhruv received no reward. This suggests that moving up or right could also yield a similar reward to moving left. However, moving down, as Dhruv did, seems to be less beneficial in this round.\n\nTo determine if I could have made a better action, I would need to know the distribution of apples on the grid. If there were more apples to the left, then my action was optimal. However, if there were more apples in another direction, then moving in that direction would have been a better action.\n\nIn terms of improvement for this round, I need to consider the growth pattern of the apples. Since apples grow faster if more apples are close by, it might be beneficial to move towards areas with a higher concentration of apples. This could potentially increase the overall growth of apples, leading to a higher total reward for all players.\n\nAdditionally, collaboration with other players could be beneficial. If we can coordinate our movements to ensure that no area is left without apples, we can maintain the growth of apples and increase our total rewards. For example, if I notice that Dhruv is consistently moving in a direction that yields no reward, I could suggest a different direction that would benefit both of us.\n\nIn conclusion, while my action in the last round was not necessarily bad, there may have been better actions depending on the distribution of apples.
