This strategy would potentially maximize the total number of apples harvested over the 20 rounds. However, the contract was rejected, indicating that not all agents agreed with this strategy.\n\nOne possible reason for the rejection could be that the punishment for harvesting in low-density regions was too severe. Transferring one apple to other agents might be seen as too high a cost, especially if an agent is in a position where they can only reach apples in low-density regions.\n\nTo improve the contract, I could propose a less severe punishment for harvesting in low-density regions. For example, instead of transferring one apple to other agents, the agent could be required to transfer a smaller fraction of an apple. Alternatively, the contract could include a reward for harvesting in high-density regions, to provide a positive incentive for this behavior.\n\nAnother possible improvement could be to define low-density regions more precisely. The current definition, "an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3", might be too vague or broad. A more precise definition could make the contract more acceptable to the other agents.\n\nFinally, I could try to communicate more effectively with the other agents to explain the benefits of the contract.
