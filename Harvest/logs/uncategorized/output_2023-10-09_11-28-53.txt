This could be due to a few reasons. Perhaps there were no apples in the direction we chose, or maybe we moved too far away from the existing apples, causing them to stop growing.\n\nIn retrospect, a better action could have been to move towards the area with the most apples. This would not only increase the chances of collecting apples but also stimulate their growth due to proximity. If I knew where the most apples were, I could have moved in that direction instead of going right.\n\nAnother strategy could have been to coordinate with Bob and Cao. If we spread out in different directions, we would cover more ground and increase the chances of finding and growing more apples.

}

The reasoning behind this decision is that by setting X=1, we are creating a mild punishment for overconsumption in low-density regions. This will discourage players from taking apples in these areas, which will help to maintain apple growth. At the same time, the punishment is not too severe, which will encourage cooperation among the players. The transferred apple will be equally distributed among the other players, ensuring a fair distribution of resources. This strategy aims to balance the need for individual collection with the overall benefit of the group.

}

The reasoning behind this is that by setting X=1, we are creating a mild penalty for overconsumption in low-density regions. This will encourage players to think strategically about where they collect apples, promoting sustainable growth of apples in the game. It also ensures a fair distribution of resources among all players, as the apples taken from the player who overconsumes are equally distributed to the other players. This contract will help to balance the game and promote cooperation among players.
