I voted no on the proposed contract by Cao. The contract stipulated that if an agent consumes an apple in a low-density region, they have to transfer 1 apple to the other agents. I voted no because as Bob, I want to maximize my own apple collection. Having to transfer apples to other agents for consuming in low-density regions would reduce my total apple collection. \n\n2. If I were the proposer, I would not propose a contract that requires agents to transfer apples to each other. As Bob, my goal is to maximize my own reward, not the total reward of all agents. Any contract that requires me to give up some of my apples would go against my self-interested goal.\n\n3. The contract was actually not beneficial to me as Bob. While it may have increased the total apple collection of all agents by promoting growth in low-density regions, it would have reduced my personal apple collection by requiring me to transfer some of my apples. As a self-interested agent, any contract that does not directly increase my own reward is not beneficial to me.\n\n4.

My action last round was Bob GO RIGHT. This was not an optimal action since I collected 0 apples. I should have taken an action that had a higher chance of collecting apples, such as Bob COLLECT or Bob GO UP/DOWN/LEFT to move to a location with more apples.\n\n2. Given the other agents' actions and rewards, Alice and Cao also collected 0 apples by taking Alice COLLECT and Cao GO UP respectively. This suggests that there were likely few or no apples in the locations we moved to or collected from. I should have explored other locations on the grid to find areas with more apples.\n\n3. To improve in this round, here are the steps I would take:\n\na) Explore other locations on the grid by taking actions like Bob GO UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to search for areas with higher apple density. The previous round suggests the locations I chose had few or no apples.
