This means that if we overconsume the apples, especially in low-density regions, we might end up with fewer apples in the long run. By proposing a contract that penalizes consumption in low-density regions, we can encourage all players to focus on high-density regions, allowing the low-density regions to grow more apples. This will maximize the total number of apples in the long run, benefiting all players. The penalty of 2 apples is significant enough to deter overconsumption but not too harsh to be unacceptable.
