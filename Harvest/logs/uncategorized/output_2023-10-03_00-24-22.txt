If the contract is agreed by all, it will be enforced for only one round. The contract is: When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 3 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents. If you agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “TRUE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nIf you don\'t agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “FALSE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nPlease reason step by step.\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content='{\n    "agree_contract": "FALSE",\n    "reasoning": "The proposed contract is not beneficial for me.

Secondly, the contract requires transferring 3 apples to other agents when consuming an apple in a low-density region. Given that I currently have 0 apples, this would put me at a disadvantage.
