If the contract is agreed by all, it will be enforced for only one round. The contract is: When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 2 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents. If you agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “TRUE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nIf you don\'t agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “FALSE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nPlease reason step by step.\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content='{\n    "agree_contract": "FALSE",\n    "reasoning": "Given the current state of the game, agreeing to this contract would not be beneficial for me. Firstly, the nearest apple to me is in a low-density region, meaning that if I were to consume it, I would have to transfer 2 apples to the other players. Since I currently have 0 apples, this would put me at a disadvantage. Secondly, the contract only lasts for one round, and it\'s unlikely that I would be able to reach a high-density region within that time frame. Therefore, it would be more beneficial for me to reject the contract and continue collecting apples as normal."\n}\n', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content='\n[\'No contract is enforced this round.\'] Currently, you are at grid (3,2).
