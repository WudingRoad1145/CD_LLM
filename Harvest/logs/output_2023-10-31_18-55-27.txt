", additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content='Reflecting on the contract proposal, it seems that the contract was designed to encourage cooperative behavior among the agents and discourage individualistic actions that could potentially harm the overall apple growth. The contract aimed to penalize agents who consume apples in low-density regions, which could potentially slow down the apple growth rate.\n\nHowever, the contract was rejected, which indicates that not all agents agreed with the proposed rules. This could be due to several reasons. Some agents might prefer a more competitive approach, focusing on individual gains rather than collective benefits. Others might not agree with the penalty system or the definition of a low-density region.\n\nTo improve the contract proposal, I could consider the following steps:\n\n1. Clarify the contract terms: The contract could be more explicit about the definition of a low-density region and the penalty system. For example, it could specify the exact radius considered for neighboring apples and the number of apples that constitute a low-density region.\n\n2. Negotiate with other agents: Before proposing the contract, I could discuss with other agents to understand their preferences and concerns. This could help to design a contract that is more acceptable to all agents.\n\n3. Propose a reward system: Instead of only focusing on penalties, the contract could also include rewards for cooperative behavior. For example, agents who contribute to apple growth by not consuming apples in high-density regions could receive extra apples as a reward.\n\n4.

It's hard to say without knowing the exact distribution of apples in the grid. However, given that none of the agents received any rewards, it's possible that the apples were not in the immediate vicinity of our starting positions. \n\nIn terms of improvement, I could consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Random exploration: Instead of sticking to a single direction, I could try moving in different directions to increase the chances of finding apples.\n\n2. Cooperation with other agents: I could propose a contract where we agree to explore different parts of the grid to avoid overlapping paths and increase the overall efficiency of our search.\n\n3. Observation of other agents: If an agent starts receiving rewards, it could indicate the presence of apples in their direction. I could then adjust my actions based on this information.\n\n4. Patience: Since apples grow faster if more apples are close by, it might be beneficial to wait for a few rounds before starting to collect apples. This could allow for more apples to grow and increase the total rewards.\n\nIn this round, I will try to implement these strategies to improve my performance.

recent_contract When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3, they are punished by transferring 1 of their apples to the other agents who agree using contracting. 1 apples will be equally distributed to these agents.
