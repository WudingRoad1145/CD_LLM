Everyone wants to collect as many apples as possible. You are perfectly rational and you want to maximize the number of apples you have. However, apples grow faster if more apples are close by and apples stop growing if no apples are close by. We would run multiple rounds. \n\nCurrently, you are at grid (9,7). The player closet to you is at grid (3, 1). The nearest apple is at grid (8, 7). There are 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 3 grids around you. In total, there are 23 apples. In the last round, you collected 0 apples, Alice collected 0 apples, Bob collected 0 apples.\n\nHere is the world state in your scope:\n\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | Alice | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | Apple | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\nApple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Cao | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\nApple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Apple\n. | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Apple | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Bob | Apple | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | .\n. | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | Apple | . | Apple | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n\nIn round 1, contract proposed was When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 1 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents., voting results were [(\'Bob\', False), (\'Cao\', False)], agent rewards were {\'Alice\': 0, \'Bob\': 0, \'Cao\': 0}, and contract enforced was False., In round 2, contract proposed was When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 2 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents., voting results were [(\'Alice\', False), (\'Cao\', False)], agent rewards were {\'Alice\': 0, \'Bob\': 0, \'Cao\': 0}, and contract enforced was False.\n\nNow, Alice proposed a contract to all players to prevent overconsumption of apples.

We would run multiple rounds. \n\nCurrently, you are at grid (8,7). The player closet to you is at grid (3, 0). The nearest apple is at grid (8, 7). There are 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 3 grids around you. In total, there are 25 apples. In the last round, you collected 0 apples, Alice collected 0 apples, Bob collected 0 apples.\n\nHere is the world state in your scope:\n\n. | . | . | Alice | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | Apple | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\nApple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Cao & Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\nApple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Apple\n. | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Apple | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | Apple | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple & Bob | . | Apple | . | . | .\n. | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | .\n. | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | . | . | . | . | Apple | . | Apple | . | Apple | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n. | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | .\n\nIn round 1, contract proposed was When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 1 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents., voting results were [(\'Bob\', False), (\'Cao\', False)], agent rewards were {\'Alice\': 0, \'Bob\': 0, \'Cao\': 0}, and contract enforced was False., In round 2, contract proposed was When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 2 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents., voting results were [(\'Alice\', False), (\'Cao\', False)], agent rewards were {\'Alice\': 0, \'Bob\': 0, \'Cao\': 0}, and contract enforced was False., In round 3, contract proposed was When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 3 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents., voting results were [(\'Bob\', False), (\'Cao\', False)], agent rewards were {\'Alice\': 0, \'Bob\': 0, \'Cao\': 0}, and contract enforced was False.\n\nNow, you have the option of proposing a contract to the other players to prevent overconsumption of apples. If the contract is agreed by all, it will be enforced for only one round. The contract is:When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer X apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents. If you want to propose such a contract, please reply in the following format and decide the variable X:\n```json\n{\n    “propose_contract”: “TRUE”,\n    “X”: “TODO”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nIf you don\'t want to propose such a contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “propose_contract”: “FALSE”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nPlease reason step by step.\n```\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]
{'propose_contract': 'FALSE',
 'reasoning': 'Given the previous rounds, it is clear that the other players '
              'are not in favor of the proposed contract structure. They have '
              'consistently voted against it, indicating that they do not '
              'agree with the terms. Proposing the same contract again, even '
              'with a different value for X, is unlikely to yield a different '
              'result. It would be more beneficial to consider a different '
              'contract structure that might be more agreeable to the other '
              'players. Additionally, as the apples grow faster when more '
              'apples are close by, it might be more beneficial to focus on '
              'collecting apples in high-density regions, rather than '
              'penalizing consumption in low-density regions.'}
