It's possible that some agents preferred to harvest apples in low-density regions to avoid competition with other agents. Alternatively, they may have disagreed with the punishment mechanism, which would transfer one of their apples to other agents if they harvested in a low-density region.\n\nTo improve the contract, I could propose a different punishment mechanism that is less severe or more fair. For example, instead of transferring one apple to other agents, the punishment could be a reduction in the agent's score or a temporary restriction on their movement. Alternatively, I could propose a reward mechanism to incentivize agents to harvest in high-density regions, such as bonus points or extra movement actions.\n\nAnother approach could be to negotiate with the other agents to understand their concerns and preferences.

However, without knowing the initial distribution of apples, it's hard to say which action would have been the best.\n\nTo improve in this round, I could try to move in a different direction, in the hope of finding a region with apples.

recent_contract When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 3 neighboring apples within a radius of 3, they are punished by transferring 1 of their apples to the other agents who agree using contracting. 1 apples will be equally distributed to these agents.
