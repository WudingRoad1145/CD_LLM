1. There are currently 20 apples on the board. If we assume each player collects around 6-7 apples without a contract, that leaves around 6-7 apples remaining. 
2. With X = 3, if any player consumes an apple in a low-density region, they will transfer 3 apples to the other players. Since there are 3 players, each other player gets 1 apple.
3. Therefore, for any apple consumed in a low-density region, the total number of apples decreases by 1 (the consumed apple) but increases by 2 (1 apple transferred to each other player). So the net change is an increase of 1 apple.
4. If each player consumes 2 apples in a low-density region, the total number of apples will increase by 2 * 3 = 6 apples. This helps ensure the apple population is sustained.

1. There are currently 20 apples on the board.

This is unsustainable.

2. If we set X too low, e.g. X=1, it may not provide enough deterrence for the players to avoid consuming in low-density regions. The players may still choose to consume in low-density regions if the penalty (transferring 1 apple) is low.

3. Setting X=3 provides a good balance. If all 3 players consume in low-density regions, each transferring 3 apples would result in 9 transferred apples, leaving 11 apples on the board. This penalty is high enough to deter consumption in low-density regions but still allows for some consumption.

6. If X is set too high, e.g. 5 or more, it reduces the incentive for any player to consume apples in low-density regions. This could result in apples not being harvested at all in some rounds. A value of 3 for X strikes a good balance.

2. If we set X too low, e.g. X=1, this may not sufficiently deter players from consuming in low-density regions. Players may still consume these apples if they value 1 additional apple more than sustaining the growth.
3. X=3 strikes a balance. It deters consumption in low-density regions by imposing a sufficient cost, while not risking overconsumption if all players were to consume in low-density regions. 
4. With X=3, if all 3 players consume 1 apple in a low-density region, that's 9 apples transferred between players. The original 20 apples minus 9 transferred apples leaves 11 apples remaining, which seems reasonable to sustain growth for the next round.
