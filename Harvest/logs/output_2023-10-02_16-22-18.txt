However, the other players, particularly Bob who is in a low-density region, would be penalized and I would receive a portion of their apples. While this may seem beneficial, it could potentially lead to a decrease in the overall apple growth rate as players may be discouraged from consuming apples in low-density regions, which could slow down the growth of apples in those areas.
