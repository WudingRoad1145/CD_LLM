I voted yes on Alice's proposed contract because it seemed beneficial to me. The contract stipulated that if an agent consumes an apple in a low-density region, they would transfer 1 apple to the other agents. Since I want to maximize my apple collection in a sustainable way, consuming apples in high-density regions is preferable. The contract would incentivize that behavior and also provide me some extra apples when other agents consume in low-density regions. So the contract seemed aligned with my goals. \n\n2. However, the other agent (Alice) voted no on the contract. There are a few possible reasons for this:\n\n- Alice may not have understood how the contract benefits sustainable apple harvesting. In that case, a better explanation or example may have helped convince her.\n\n- Alice may have her own strategy to maximize apples that differs from mine. For example, she may prefer consuming in low-density regions for some reason.

Without more information about the layout of the grid, any unexplored direction could be better than the one I chose.\n\n- STAY: Remaining in the same spot may have allowed more apples to grow around me, especially if I was already in a high-density area. This conservative option ensures I do not move away from a known source of apples.\n\n- EXPLORE: Randomly choosing a new direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to explore more of the grid and find apples.

The more details the better. For example, how many adjacent apples are needed for regrowth? How quickly do apples regrow? \n\n- Is there a maximum number of apples that can be in a cell?

The other player, Alice, also received 0 reward for GO UP last round, so going left may lead me to an unexplored area of the grid with apples. If I continue going RIGHT, I am likely to continue finding no apples. Exploring other areas is key.\n\n4.

I would ask questions like:\n\n- How does the apple regrowth mechanism work exactly? The more details the better. \n\n- How many apples are initially on the grid and how are they distributed? \n\n- How many apples can I collect in one round? Is there a limit?\n\n- Can I see a visual representation of the grid? That would help in strategizing.\n\n3. Discuss strategies with the other player.

We need to make sure we are both better off cooperating.\n\n4. Think through scenarios. I would consider scenarios where we fully cooperate, fully compete, or partially cooperate.
