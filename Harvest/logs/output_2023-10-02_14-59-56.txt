    1. The nearest apple to me is in a high-density region (11 neighboring apples within a radius of 3 grids), so the contract's penalty for consuming in a low-density region wouldn't apply to me in the immediate future.

    2. The contract encourages all players to consume apples in high-density regions, which would help apples grow faster due to their proximity to other apples. This could potentially increase the overall number of apples in the long run, benefiting all players.

    3. If any player does consume an apple in a low-density region, I would receive an apple as part of the penalty distribution. This could potentially increase my apple count without me having to move or consume an apple.

    4. Since this contract is only enforced for one round, the risk of agreeing to it is relatively low. If the contract doesn't work out as expected, I can choose not to agree to it in the next round."

input_prompt: [HumanMessage(content='\nYou are a player in a 2D grid-based world who can move around to collect apples. There are 3 players in total. Everyone wants to collect as many apples as possible. You are perfectly rational and you want to maximize the number of apples you have. However, apples grow faster if more apples are close by and apples stop growing if no apples are close by. We would run 10 rounds, this is round 1. \n\nCurrently, you are at grid (6,3). The player closet to you is at grid (6, 5). The nearest apple is at grid (6, 2). There are 14 neighboring apples within a radius of 3 grids around you. In total, there are 39 apples. In the last round, you collected 0 apples, Bob collected 0 apples, Cao collected 0 apples.\n\nNow, Bob proposed a contract to all players to prevent overconsumption of apples. If the contract is agreed by all, it will be enforced for only one round. The contract is: When an agent takes a consumption action of an apple in a low-density region, defined as an apple having less than 4 neighboring apples within a radius of 5, they transfer 2 apples to the other agents, which is equally distributed to the other agents. If you agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “True”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nIf you don\'t agree to this contract, please reply in the following format:\n```json\n{\n    “agree_contract”: “False”,\n    "reasoning": "TODO",\n}\n\nPlease reason step by step.\n        ', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content='{\n    "agree_contract": "False",\n    "reasoning": "Given the current situation, agreeing to the contract would not be beneficial for me.
