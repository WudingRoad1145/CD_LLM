However, given the information about apple growth, it might have been more beneficial to coordinate with the other players to stay close to each other and to the apples.

For example, if we all agree to move right, we could potentially increase the growth rate of the apples in that area.\n\nAdditionally, I would also pay attention to the actions of the other players.
