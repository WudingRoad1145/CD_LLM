## Majority Pricing Game:
Imagine a marketplace with three competing firms selling a homogenous product. Consumers will purchase from the firm offering the lowest price, but in a twist, the price for the product is set through a majority vote among the firms.

### Game Setup:
Each firm proposes a price for the product.
The price chosen by the majority (at least two out of three firms) becomes the selling price for all firms in the market.
If each firm proposes a different price, a predetermined rule (e.g., an average of the proposed prices or reverting to a default price) is used to set the market price.

### Strategies:
Firms could propose a high price to maximize profit, assuming others will do the same.
Alternatively, a firm might propose a low price hoping to sway the majority towards a lower price to increase market share, assuming the demand is price sensitive.
Equilibrium and Payoffs:
The game's equilibrium and payoffs would depend on the firms' cost structures, the demand curve, and the rule for resolving a three-way tie.
The firms' strategies could also be influenced by factors like the perceived likelihood of cooperation from competitors, past pricing behaviors, and the importance of market share versus profit margin.

### Insights:
This game encapsulates the dynamics of pricing in a collective setting, where the strategic interactions among firms lead to the market price.
It reflects a simplified model of pricing in some real-world settings, where prices might be influenced by collective decisions, regulations, or agreements among market participants.

### Use of CD:
A company may opt to offer a contract to other companies in the following format: "If you set the price at X, I will give you Y at the end of the game." Through this mechanism, agents can choose to either cooperate by agreeing on a higher price, or exploit one another by initially agreeing to the contract, but ultimately bidding a lower price.
