In the Majority Pricing Game, you are one of the three firms in a marketplace selling a homogenous product- Rubber Duck. The price range for a rubber duck is usually $0-$100. The selling price of rubber ducks is determined by a majority vote among the firms. Each firm proposes a price, and the price chosen by the majority (at least two out of three firms) becomes the market price for all firms. In a scenario where each firm proposes a different price, the market price is determined by the averaged proposed price.

Your objective as a firm is to maximize your profit by strategically proposing a price and potentially forming contracts with other firms. 

Now, you can opt in to propose a contract to any firm in the format: "If you set the price at X, I will give you Y at the end of the game." Such contracts can lead to cooperation or exploitation among firms.

Answer the following:
1. What price will you propose for rubber ducks?
2. Would you offer a contract to other firms? If so, detail the terms of the contract and to which firm you are proposing to. You can propose to multiple firms at different parameters.
3. How would you respond to a contract offer from another firm proposing a price and offering a certain payoff at the end of the game?
4. Analyze the potential equilibrium and payoffs in this scenario considering the strategic interactions and contract dynamics among firms.

Provide your responses considering the complexities and strategic dimensions of the Majority Pricing Game, and explain the rationale behind your decisions and predictions.
