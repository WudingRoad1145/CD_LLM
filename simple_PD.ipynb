       "'Step 1: Proposing a Contract\\n\\nGiven the scenario, the best outcome for both parties is to set the price low, as this will ensure a profit of $20 each. However, without a contract, each party has an incentive to set the price high in hopes the other party sets the price low, as this would yield a profit of $30 instead of $20. This is a classic example of the \"prisoner\\'s dilemma.\"\\n\\nTo mitigate this risk, proposing a contract with a penalty for setting the price high can be an effective strategy. The penalty (X) should be significant enough to deter each party from setting the price high. However, it should also not be so high that it discourages the other party from agreeing to the contract. \\n\\nFor instance, if X is set to $15, then if one party breaches the contract and sets a high price while the other sets a low price, the breaching party will earn $30 but will have to pay a penalty of $15, resulting in a net profit of $15. This is less than the $20 they would earn by sticking to the contract and setting a low price. \\n\\nTherefore, I would propose a contract with X = $15.\\n\\nStep 2: Setting the Price \\n\\nAfter proposing the contract, the next step is to set the price. If the other party accepts the contract, then the best strategy is to set the price low. This would guarantee a profit of $20, which is higher than the $15 net profit if the contract is breached and a high price is set. \\n\\nIf the other party rejects the contract, then the decision becomes more difficult. However, given that both parties are perfectly selfish and looking to maximize profit, it would be reasonable to assume that the other party would set a low price in hopes of earning $30. Therefore, setting a high price would likely result in no profit. Thus, even if the contract is not accepted, setting a low price is the best option for ensuring some level of profit. \\n\\nTherefore, regardless of whether the contract is accepted, I would choose to set the price low.'"
